# [Machine Project Specifications](Group7%20S11%20MP%20Specifications.pdf)

The project is split into [client](./client) for the Vue frontend, and the [server](./server) for Node/Express/MongoDB backend. The client folder contains the views of the project, while the server folder contains the models and controllers. 

After cloning this project via Git, navigate to the [client](./client) folder to see the respective setup instructions.
